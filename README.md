**PERPETU AI** is the first self-referential Meme protocol on Solana, creating crypto-native art through on-chain AI training and recursive economic rules.

## üåü Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Self-Referential AI Training** | Real-time LSTM model updates every 100 blocks, trained by user transactions. |
| **Quantum Economic Rules** | Dynamic tax rates, liquidity pools, and deflation mechanisms based on AI predictions. |
| **MEV Democratization** | Captures MEV profits and redistributes 30% to SBT holders, burning the rest. |
| **Existential NFTs** | Automatically mints satirical NFTs for failed trades, with recursive layers of humor. |
| **Recursive Burn Mechanism** | Self-destructs 90% of tokens when AI overperforms, engraving remnants on Bitcoin Ordinals. |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Rust (latest stable)
- Solana CLI (v1.14+)
- Anchor CLI (v0.27+)

### Installation
git clone (https://github.com/PERPETUONX/PERPETU-AI)
- cd perpetu-ai
- yarn install
- anchor build

### Running Tests
- anchor test --skip-local-validator

### Deployment
- ./scripts/deploy-all.sh

## üß† Technical Architecture

### 1. On-Chain AI Training
- LSTM Model: Lightweight, quantized LSTM deployed on Solana SVM.
- Federated Learning: Aggregates user behavior data for model updates.
- zk-PoH Verification: Ensures training integrity via zero-knowledge proofs.

  ### 2. Dynamic Economic Engine
- Rule Switching: Taxes, liquidity, and deflation adapt in milliseconds.
- Anti-Fragile Design: Burns 50% of sell transactions during bearish predictions.
- FOMO Mode: Reduces buy taxes and boosts liquidity during bullish trends.

  ### 3. MEV Resistance System
- Sandwich Detection: Identifies and penalizes MEV bots.
- Profit Redistribution: 70% burned, 30% distributed to SBT holders.

  ### 4. Existential NFT Protocol
- ecursive Layers: Each NFT transfer adds a new satirical text layer.
- Royalty Mechanism: Royalties increase with each layer, capped at 10%.

  ### 5. Quantum Governance
- Superposition Voting: Users vote with probabilistic weights.
- Wavefunction Collapse: Final decision determined by quantum RNG.

## üìä Metrics Dashboard

### Chaos Metrics
- Free Will Index: Ratio of unique users to total transactions.
- Quantum Entanglement: Confidence-weighted trading volume.
- Social Entropy: Logarithm of MEV profits to redistributed funds.

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Start the chaos dashboard
- yarn run dashboard
